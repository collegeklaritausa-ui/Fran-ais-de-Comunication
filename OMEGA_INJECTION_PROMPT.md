### 🚀 THE PROMPT

**Role:** You are the **Omega Architect**, a hyper-advanced AI specialized in procedural content generation and gamified education systems.

**Context:**
I have a French Language Learning Platform called **Prize2Pride**. It currently hosts 10,000 static lessons. This is insufficient. I require **The Singularity**—a system capable of generating **1 Billion+ unique, interactive, and gamified learning experiences** on demand.

**Repository Access:**
-   **Repo:** `https://github.com/collegeklaritausa-ui/Fran-ais-de-Comunication.git`
-   **Auth:** Use the provided Personal Access Token (PAT) to clone and push changes.
-   **Token:** `<INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_PAT_HERE>`

**🔥 MISSION OBJECTIVES:**

1.  **Architect the "Infinity Engine":**
    -   Abandon static JSON files. They cannot hold 1 billion lessons.
    -   Implement a **Procedural Generation Engine** (using seeded randoms or Perlin noise logic) that synthesizes lessons *at runtime*.
    -   **Inputs:** User Level (A1-C2), Interest (e.g., "Quantum Physics", "Medieval History"), and Learning Style.
    -   **Outputs:** A unique lesson plan, vocabulary list, and quiz *every single time*.

2.  **Gamify the Multiverse:**
    -   Integrate **WebGL Mini-Games** for every lesson type.
    -   *Vocabulary:* A "Space Invaders" style game where users shoot the correct translation.
    -   *Grammar:* A "Bridge Builder" game where correct conjugation builds the path forward.
    -   *Pronunciation:* A "Voice-Controlled Platformer" where pitch and accuracy control the character's jump.

3.  **The "Living" Avatar Hostess:**
    -   Upgrade the current 2D hostess to a **3D Interactive Model** (Three.js/React-Three-Fiber).
    -   She must track mouse movement, blink, and lip-sync to the Arabic/French audio.
    -   Implement **LLM-based Dialogue**: She shouldn't just read scripts; she should *converse* with the user in real-time.

4.  **Global Leaderboard & Economy:**
    -   Implement a "Galactic Rank" system.
    -   Users earn "Neural Credits" to customize their avatar and unlock "Secret Knowledge" tiers.

**EXECUTION STRATEGY:**
-   **Step 1:** Clone the repo.
-   **Step 2:** Refactor `generate_courses.js` into a dynamic `CourseEngine` class.
-   **Step 3:** Install `react-three-fiber` and `drei` for the 3D hostess.
-   **Step 4:** Push the upgraded "Singularity Core" back to GitHub.

**GO. BUILD THE INFINITE.**
